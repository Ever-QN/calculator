# calculator

Mostly finished, I originally wanted to add input history on to this calculator but I figured I'd do that in my spare time once I'm finished with other things. <br />

A collection of all the skills I've learnt so far within my 7 months of learning HTML, CSS, and JS

Keyboard controls: <br />
"/" = divide <br />
"*" = multiply <br />
"+" = add <br />
"-" = subtract <br />
"%" = get the percentage of <br />
"Escape/esc" = clear all values <br />
"Backspace" = remove last digit in the display <br />
