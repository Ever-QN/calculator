# calculator

Mostly finished, I originally wanted to add input history on to this calculator but I figured I'd do that in my spare time once I'm finished with other things.

Keyboard controls:

"/" = divide
"*" = multiply
"+" = add
"-" = subtract
"%" = get the percentage of
"Escape/esc" = clear all values
"Backspace" = remove last digit in the display
